## Project Description

The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data. Using the Etsy Shops Dataset discover if there are particular attributes of the shops (e.g. location, number of reviews and followers) that may impact their success.

     - Distribution of the data
     - Correlation
     - Main outcomes

## Results

 - The majority of the shops are US based, but there is also a good number of shops based in UK.
 - The US based shops have a higher number of favorers compared to non US based.
 - The majority of a newly created shops have between 0 and 2,5 sales.
 - Sales Count has the highest correlation with review count and the number of favorers. It means that the social aspect is very important in order to sell more.
 - Interestingly, sale message has a very low correlation with the number of sales!
 
 ## Next Steps
 
 - It would be interesting to collect more variables about the shops and users. 
 - Collect data for a year and check how the sales are changing depending on the months (seasonalities)
 - Investigate the sales and the dependencies of the variables per category of the product
 - Investigate the user profile of Etsy, how often buy, what's the average value of the cart, which categories are most popular
